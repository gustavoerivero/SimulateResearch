  To switch to developer mode, it is necessary to remove 
  the bars that disable the "distribution" attribute in 
  "preview" and comment out the "preview" attributes that 
  are listed.

  Then, execute the following command:

  eas build --profile development --platform android

  Otherwise, the "distribution" attribute is commented in 
  "preview" and the listed "preview" attributes are enabled.

  Then, execute the following command:

  eas build -p android --profile preview
